        <p>My time here at MBC has been fun and enducating with what I have learned. 
            The small classes allow me to learn much easier as my teacher isn't distracted
            on 100 students at a time.

        <h2>About me</h2>
        <p>I was born in Forest Lake and moved to colorado when I was a kid. Once I turned 17, me and my family moved back to Minisota.
            I then started to work for a Culver's and became a manager there. After that I
            Worked at a warehouse for target, and currently am employed with best buy as a 
            computer sales consultant.
